        <h1>New England Garden Design</h1>
        <p> <h3> Colonial Revival </h3> The period between 1600-1775 was focussed on the efforts toward independence. Colonial garden plots would consist of fruit trees, vegetables, herbs and flower bulbs. New World plants were introduced to the settlers, including; Tobacco, Native Trees, and Corn, Shurbs, Vines, and Wildflowers and they were frequently used in their gardens. 
        </p>
        <p> <h3> Colonial Garden Design </h3> 
        The style of garden inspiration dervied from Tudor and Medeival designs. Many practacalities were taken into consideration: gardens were proportional to faimly size, with livestock pens and walkways in rural areas. Working class and wealthy landowners would have more elaborate gardens. Symmetrical gardens would frame walkways in a formal arrangement. Additional focal points would include wells, fountains, seating, and trees throughout. </p>
