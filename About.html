    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
      The Kelowna Flower Garden Club is being introduced May 1st, 2026.
      The founder, Silken Rauhala, has been involved in environmental
      organizations since completing a Bachelor of Science in Victoria,
      British Columbia.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her experience includes the University of Victoria Parks Club,
      Trial Islands Restoration, Todd Inlet Remediation, and extensive
      visits to the Horticulture Centre of the Pacific and Butchart Gardens.
    </p>

    <p>
      She has documented flora across South America, remote regions of
      Northern British Columbia, the Great Lakes of Ontario, and Southern
      California. Her goal is to bring this passion to the Okanagan and
      grow a community-centered garden society.
